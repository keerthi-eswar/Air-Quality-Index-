# Air-Quality-Index-
The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a standardized system used to measure and report the quality of air in a specific area. It converts complex data about air pollutants into a simple numerical value, usually ranging from 0 to 500, to indicate how clean or polluted the air is and the potential health effects.
